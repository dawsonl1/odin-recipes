        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with your choice of toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
